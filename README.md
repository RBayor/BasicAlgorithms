# Basic Algorithms in JavaScrip and Go

### AIM

The aim of this repository is to provide a basic understanding of the basic algorithms in JavaScript and Go.

It is not intended to use best practices or optimizations but to outline similarities and differences between the two languages in my own learning process.

Feel free to fork and contribute!
Corrections and improvements are welcome.

You can also make suggestions on algrithms you'd like to see added.
